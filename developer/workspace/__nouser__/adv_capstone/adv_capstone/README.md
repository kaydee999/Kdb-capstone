## Where to start

Go to AdvancedCapstone.Project -> AdvProject.md. In here you will find project description and Questions. 

It would be a good idea to add your code to AdvProject.md and continue to keep a backup up locally by copy & pasting somewhere. You can also work in the scratchpad and/or AdvancedCapstone.Functions.

## Testing your code

### testSection
You will notice at the end of each section an option to run testSection[exercise] where exercise can be one of exercise1 exercise2 exercise3.

This is a chance for you to test code in this section before moving onto the next. 

### submitProject
If all of these pass then submitProject should also return with no Fails. Once you this is done and you have submitted the survey then you are done and should receive a certificate by email confirming this.

### AdvancedCapstone.Functions.test
You will also see a module called AdvancedCapstone.Functions.test - this contains some tests you can run throughout the project too. 

These are mentioned inline in the appropriate places in AdvProject.md. These can be useful if you are stuck on a question and would like to see expected behaviour with some sample data.
